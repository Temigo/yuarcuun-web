</p>

<p>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? 
</p>
<p><i>In Short:  We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.  
</i></p>

No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
</p>

</p>
<p><i>In Short:  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

</p>

<p>8. DATA BREACH
</p>

You will be notified about data breaches when Lower Kuskokwim School District believes you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being.

</p>

<p>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES 
</p>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.  
</p>
